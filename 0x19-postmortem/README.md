Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 15, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC) - May 16, 2023, 4:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete service outage during the specified duration. Users were unable to access the website, resulting in a 100% service disruption.

Timeline:
- May 15, 2023, 10:00 AM (UTC): The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden drop in incoming traffic.
- An engineer noticed the abnormality and initiated an investigation.
- Actions taken: The investigation focused on the web server and database components. It was assumed that a recent configuration change or hardware failure might have caused the issue.
- Misleading investigation paths: Initially, the investigation centered around recent code deployments, but no evident issues were found. Database query optimizations were also explored, but they proved to be unrelated.
- The incident was escalated to the DevOps team and the senior software engineer for further analysis and resolution.
- May 16, 2023, 4:00 PM (UTC): The incident was resolved, and the web application was restored to full functionality.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a disk space exhaustion issue on the web server. The disk partition containing the application logs had reached its capacity limit, causing critical system processes to fail.

Resolution: The issue was fixed by freeing up disk space on the affected partition. The logs were purged, and a script was implemented to regularly rotate and compress logs to prevent future space-related problems. Additionally, monitoring thresholds were adjusted to trigger alerts before reaching critical disk space levels.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Improve log management: Implement a log rotation and compression strategy to ensure that disk space usage remains within acceptable limits.
   - Task: Develop and deploy a log rotation script within the next two weeks.
   - Task: Configure log compression to conserve disk space within one month.

2. Enhance monitoring capabilities: Implement proactive monitoring to detect disk space usage and alert when it exceeds defined thresholds.
   - Task: Add disk space monitoring with appropriate thresholds within the next two weeks.
   - Task: Set up automated alerts to notify the operations team when disk space is nearing capacity within one month.

3. Conduct regular capacity planning: Perform regular assessments of system resources, including disk space, to identify potential bottlenecks and prevent future outages.
   - Task: Conduct a comprehensive capacity planning review within the next month.
   - Task: Develop and implement a capacity planning strategy to anticipate future resource requirements within three months.

4. Conduct post-incident analysis: Review incident response and debugging processes to identify areas for improvement and learning.
   - Task: Schedule a post-incident analysis meeting with the involved teams within the next week.
   - Task: Document lessons learned and distribute findings to the relevant teams within two weeks.

By addressing the aforementioned measures and tasks, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future, improve system stability, and enhance our overall incident response capabilities.
